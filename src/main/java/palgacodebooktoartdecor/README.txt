The PALGACodebookToArtDecor is included here with an added TSV implementation for Codebook, allowing this tool to use the output from ToPALGACodebook.java.
Also, any GUI components have been removed.
The intention is to refactor PALGACodebookToArtDecor into a 'core' library that can be reused and expanded in projects such as these, instead of making a copy of the codebase.
