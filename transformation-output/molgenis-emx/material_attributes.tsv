materialidentifier	Material identifier	The unique identification of a material in a specific context.	material	string	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	
belongstoperson	Belongs to person	Link to the person from whom the material was collected.	material	xref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	fair-genomes_personal
belongstodiagnosis	Belongs to diagnosis	This material is part of a diagnosis c.q. clinical examination. There can be multiple diagnoses when a non-tumor material is reused as reference.	material	mref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	fair-genomes_clinical
samplingtimestamp	Sampling timestamp	Date and time at which this sample was collected.	material	datetime	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
registrationtimestamp	Registration timestamp	The act of listing or recording officially; officially qualified or enrolled.	material	datetime	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
samplingprotocol	Sampling protocol	Describes the procedure whereby biological material for an experiment is sampled.	material	text	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
deviationfromprotocol	Deviation from protocol	A variation from processes or procedures defined in the sampling protocol. Deviations usually do not preclude the overall evaluability of subject data for either efficacy or safety, and are often acknowledged and accepted in advance by the sponsor.	material	string	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
reasonfordeviation	Reason for deviation	The rationale for why a deviation from the sampling protocol has occurred.	material	string	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

expirationdate	Expiration date	The date beyond which a substance is no longer regarded as fit for use.	material	date	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
percentagetumorcells	Percentage tumor cells	The determination of the ratio of tumor cells compared to total cells present in a sample. The measurement may be expressed as a ratio or percentage.	material	decimal	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
physicallocation	Physical location	A reference to a place on the Earth, by its name or by its geographical location. This definition is intentionally vague to allow reuse locally (e.g. which freezer), for contacting (e.g. which institute), broadly for logistical or legal reasons (e.g. city, country or continent).	material	string	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
derivedfrom	Derived from	A material produced from or related to another. [WORK IN PROGRESS. This field should be proper ReferenceOne to Material, but this is technically problematic due to circular dependencies.]	material	string	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
