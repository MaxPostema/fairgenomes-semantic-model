Plasma	Plasma is the fluid (acellular) portion of the circulating blood, as distinguished from the serum that is the fluid portion of the blood obtained by removal of the fibrin clot and blood cells after coagulation.	MIABIS-2.0-14	material-type:Plasma	https://github.com/BBMRI-ERIC/miabis/blob/master/Structured-data-and-lists.md#material-type:Plasma
RNA	One of two types of nucleic acid made by cells. RNA contains information that has been copied from DNA (the other type of nucleic acid). Cells make several different forms of RNA, and each form has a specific job in the cell. Many forms of RNA have functions related to making proteins. RNA is also the genetic material of some viruses instead of DNA. RNA can be made in the laboratory and used in research studies. Also called ribonucleic acid.

Serum	The clear portion of the blood that remains after the removal of the blood cells and the clotting proteins.	MIABIS-2.0-14	material-type:Serum	https://github.com/BBMRI-ERIC/miabis/blob/master/Structured-data-and-lists.md#material-type:Serum
Tissue (Frozen)	An anatomical structure consisting of similarly specialized cells and intercellular matrix, aggregated according to genetically determined spatial relationships, performing a specific function.

Tissue (FFPE)	Tissue, formalin fixated and paraffin preserved or equivalent.	MIABIS-2.0-14	material-type:Tissue_(FFPE)	https://github.com/BBMRI-ERIC/miabis/blob/master/Structured-data-and-lists.md#material-type:Tissue_(FFPE)
Urine	The fluid that is excreted by the kidneys. It is stored in the bladder and discharged through the urethra.	MIABIS-2.0-14	material-type:Urine	https://github.com/BBMRI-ERIC/miabis/blob/master/Structured-data-and-lists.md#material-type:Urine
NoInformation (NI, nullflavor)	The value is exceptional (missing, omitted, incomplete, improper). No information as to the reason for being an exceptional value is provided. This is the most general exceptional value. It is also the default exceptional value.	HL7	NI	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#NI
Invalid (INV, nullflavor)	The value as represented in the instance is not a member of the set of permitted data values in the constrained value domain of a variable.	HL7	INV	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#INV
Derived (DER, nullflavor)	An actual value may exist, but it must be derived from the provided information (usually an EXPR generic data type extension will be used to convey the derivation expression .	HL7	DER	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#DER
Other (OTH, nullflavor)	The actual value is not a member of the set of permitted data values in the constrained value domain of a variable.The actual value is not a member of the set of permitted data values in the constrained value domain of a variable. (e.g., concept not provided by required code system).	HL7	OTH	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#OTH
Negative infinity (NINF, nullflavor)	Negative infinity of numbers.	HL7	NINF	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#NINF
Positive infinity (PINF, nullflavor)	Positive infinity of numbers.	HL7	PINF	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#PINF
Un-encoded (UNC, nullflavor)	The actual value has not yet been encoded within the approved value domain.	HL7	UNC	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#UNC
Masked (MSK, nullflavor)	There is information on this item available but it has not been provided by the sender due to security, privacy or other reasons. There may be an alternate mechanism for gaining access to this information.	HL7	MSK	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#MSK
Not applicable (NA, nullflavor)	Known to have no proper value (e.g., last menstrual period for a male).	HL7	NA	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#NA
Unknown (UNK, nullflavor)	A proper value is applicable, but not known.	HL7	UNK	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#UNK
Asked but unknown (ASKU, nullflavor)	Information was sought but not found (e.g., patient was asked but didn't know)	HL7	ASKU	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#ASKU
Temporarily unavailable (NAV, nullflavor)	Information is not available at this time but it is expected that it will be available later.	HL7	NAV	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#NAV
Not asked (NASK, nullflavor)	This information has not been sought. (e.g., patient was not asked)	HL7	NASK	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#NASK
Not available (NAVU, nullflavor)	Information is not available at this time (with no expectation regarding whether it will or will not be available in the future).	HL7	NAVU	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#NAVU
Sufficient quantity (QS, nullflavor)	The specific quantity is not known, but is known to be non-zero and is not specified because it makes up the bulk of the material. e.g. 'Add 10mg of ingredient X, 50mg of ingredient Y, and sufficient quantity of water to 100mL.' The null flavor would be used to express the quantity of water.	HL7	QS	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#QS
Trace (TRC, nullflavor)	The content is greater than zero, but too small to be quantified.	HL7	TRC	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#TRC
