sampleprepidentifier	Sampleprep identifier	Any of one or more unique codes that refers to a specific protocol.	samplepreparation	string	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	
belongstomaterial	Belongs to material	Link to the material from which this sample was prepared.	samplepreparation	xref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	fair-genomes_material
inputamount	Input amount	Amount of input material in ng.	samplepreparation	int	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
librarypreparationkit	Library preparation kit	Pre-filled, ready-to-use reagent cartridges. Used to produce improved chemistry, cluster density and read length as well as improve quality (Q) scores. Reagent components are encoded to interact with the sequencing system to validate compatibility with user-defined applications.	samplepreparation	xref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	fair-genomes_samplepreparation_librarypreparationkit
pcrfree	PCR free	A method for amplifying a DNA base sequence using multiple rounds of heat denaturation of the DNA and annealing of oligonucleotide primers complementary to flanking regions in the presence of a heat-stable polymerase. This results in duplication of the targeted DNA region. Newly synthesized DNA strands can subsequently serve as additional templates for the same primer sequences, so that successive rounds of primer annealing, strand elongation, and dissociation produce rapid and highly specific amplification of the desired sequence. PCR also can be used to detect the existence of the defined sequence in a DNA sample.	samplepreparation	bool	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
targetenrichmentkit	Target enrichment kit	Any of various techniques designed to select or increase a target item in a mixed sample.	samplepreparation	xref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	fair-genomes_samplepreparation_targetenrichmentkit
umispresent	UMIs present	A unique molecular identifier (UMI) barcode is a short nucleotide sequence that is used to identify reads originating from an individual mRNA molecule.	samplepreparation	bool	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
intendedinsertsize	Intended insert size	In paired-end sequencing, the DNA between the adapter sequences is the insert. The length of this sequence is known as the insert size, not to be confused with the inner distance between reads. So, fragment length equals read adapter length (2x) plus insert size, and insert size equals read lenght (2x) plus inner distance.	samplepreparation	int	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
intendedreadlength	Intended read length	The number of nucleotides successfully ordered from each side of a nucleic acid fragment obtained after the completion of a sequencing process.	samplepreparation	int	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
