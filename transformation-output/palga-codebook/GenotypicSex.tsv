NoInformation (NI, nullflavor)	The value is exceptional (missing, omitted, incomplete, improper). No information as to the reason for being an exceptional value is provided. This is the most general exceptional value. It is also the default exceptional value.	HL7	NI	NoInformation (NI, nullflavor)
Invalid (INV, nullflavor)	The value as represented in the instance is not a member of the set of permitted data values in the constrained value domain of a variable.	HL7	INV	Invalid (INV, nullflavor)
Derived (DER, nullflavor)	An actual value may exist, but it must be derived from the provided information (usually an EXPR generic data type extension will be used to convey the derivation expression .	HL7	DER	Derived (DER, nullflavor)
Other (OTH, nullflavor)	The actual value is not a member of the set of permitted data values in the constrained value domain of a variable.The actual value is not a member of the set of permitted data values in the constrained value domain of a variable. (e.g., concept not provided by required code system).	HL7	OTH	Other (OTH, nullflavor)
Negative infinity (NINF, nullflavor)	Negative infinity of numbers.	HL7	NINF	Negative infinity (NINF, nullflavor)
Positive infinity (PINF, nullflavor)	Positive infinity of numbers.	HL7	PINF	Positive infinity (PINF, nullflavor)
Un-encoded (UNC, nullflavor)	The actual value has not yet been encoded within the approved value domain.	HL7	UNC	Un-encoded (UNC, nullflavor)
Masked (MSK, nullflavor)	There is information on this item available but it has not been provided by the sender due to security, privacy or other reasons. There may be an alternate mechanism for gaining access to this information.	HL7	MSK	Masked (MSK, nullflavor)
Not applicable (NA, nullflavor)	Known to have no proper value (e.g., last menstrual period for a male).	HL7	NA	Not applicable (NA, nullflavor)
Unknown (UNK, nullflavor)	A proper value is applicable, but not known.	HL7	UNK	Unknown (UNK, nullflavor)
Asked but unknown (ASKU, nullflavor)	Information was sought but not found (e.g., patient was asked but didn't know)	HL7	ASKU	Asked but unknown (ASKU, nullflavor)
Temporarily unavailable (NAV, nullflavor)	Information is not available at this time but it is expected that it will be available later.	HL7	NAV	Temporarily unavailable (NAV, nullflavor)
Not asked (NASK, nullflavor)	This information has not been sought. (e.g., patient was not asked)	HL7	NASK	Not asked (NASK, nullflavor)
Not available (NAVU, nullflavor)	Information is not available at this time (with no expectation regarding whether it will or will not be available in the future).	HL7	NAVU	Not available (NAVU, nullflavor)
Sufficient quantity (QS, nullflavor)	The specific quantity is not known, but is known to be non-zero and is not specified because it makes up the bulk of the material. e.g. 'Add 10mg of ingredient X, 50mg of ingredient Y, and sufficient quantity of water to 100mL.' The null flavor would be used to express the quantity of water.	HL7	QS	Sufficient quantity (QS, nullflavor)
Trace (TRC, nullflavor)	The content is greater than zero, but too small to be quantified.	HL7	TRC	Trace (TRC, nullflavor)
